Ver 1.0

Thank you for downloading my tool -thecolonel63

Bash script by Archie Halliwell

Notes:

This tool is extremely experimental! Use at your own risk (Expect some features to not work)

This tool works on Linux (it should also work on WSL)

It requires Zip, FFmpeg, bash, and GNU core utils

Tested on ubuntu 20.04 with ffmpeg version 4.2.4-1ubuntu0.1 and Zip 3.0 (July 5th 2008), by Info-ZIP.

Instructions:

1) Put your video "input-original.mp4" in the main directory

2) Run "HDConvert.sh"

3) If you are keeping the original aspect ratio (if it is 480p resolution or lower), 
just hit enter, otherwise, type 1 and hit enter to skip the aspect ratio conversion.

4) Wait until it says "Done!"

5) Copy "out/VideoWorld" into your saves directory and load it up!
